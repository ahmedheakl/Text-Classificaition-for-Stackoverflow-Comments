# Text-Classificaition-for-Stackoverflow-Comments
This a code for an architecture of a Deep Neural Network for text classification. 
I used a dataset from stackoverflow, which classifies the comments of the user into 4 categories according to the programming language the comment is about. I used an TextVectorization, full-connected, Embedding and Global Pooling to build the model. 
Within 20 epochs, i got 80% on the validation and test datasets.


Note that I already have the link for the library in the code.
